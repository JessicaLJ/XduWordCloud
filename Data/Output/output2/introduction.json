[" The World Wide Web (WWW) contains a vast amount of information of varying quality.In this paper, we focus on the problem of assisting a person to find information that sat- isfies long-term, recurring goals (such as finding information on machine applications in medicine) rather than short-term goals (such as find a paper by a particular author (Armstrong et al., 1995)).", "We define the \"interestingness\" of a web page as the relevance of the page with respect to the user's long-term information goals.", "Feedback on the interestingness of a set of previously visited sites can be used to learn a profile that would predict the interestingness of unseen sites.", "Since learning accurate classifiers often requires a great deal of data and users may be unwilling to rate many sites before accurate predictions are made, we allow the user to provide an initial profile that is then revised when the user rates visited sites.", "We will show that revising profiles results in more accurate classifications, particularly with small training sets.", "In this paper, we give a brief overview of Syskill & Webert (Pazzani et al., 1996), an intelligent agent we designed to learn profiles.", "Syskill & Webert identifies informative words from Web pages to use as Boolean features, and learns a naive Bayesian classifier to determine the interestingness of pages.", "After an initial description of Syskill & Webert, we then discuss a number of issues in the learning and revision of profiles.", "\u00b7 Do more sophisticated and computationally expensive classifiers provide a benefit over the naive Bayesian classifier?", "314 M. PAZZANI AND D. BILLSUS \u00b7 How can an initial user profile be used to increase the accuracy of initial predictions?", "\u00b7 What additional knowledge can be brought to bear on the problem to increase the accuracy of predictions?"]
