(simplicity).", "The constructive induction method used is \"peak merging.\"", "New peaks (hypothesis disjuncts) EVALUATION AND SELECTION OF BIASES  19 are formed by constructing new terms (attributes).", "Each new peak is comprised of multiple old peaks.", "As mentioned at the beginning of this section, a pertinent question to ask is, \"What evaluation method facilitates bias selection?\"", "Matheus (1991) presents a framework in which he elaborates sources upon which to base the evaluation of a bias shift involving feature construction (e.g., peak merging).", "These sources are the instances, the hypotheses, and the domain knowledge.", "6.2.2.", "Prior knowledge Prior knowledge can be used to reduce the search space and guide the selection of representational and procedural biases.", "Learning and modifying this prior knowledge thus amounts to searching the meta-bias level.", "Although none of the papers in this issue focus on this topic, it is an important and active area of research.", "In 1992, desJardins chaired a AAAI workshop entitled \"Constraining Learning with Prior Knowledge\" that explored novel approaches for using existing knowledge to reduce the computationat complexity of the learning problem, including the evaluation and selection of biases.", "Russell and Grosof (1987) first introduced the concept of declarative bias, an explicit specification of the representational bias I(H).", "The advantage of declarative bias is that because the bias is represented explicitly, it is easy to analyze and modify it when necessary.", "GRENDEL (Cohen 1995) allows a u s e r to specify blas declaratively in a FOIL-like inductive learning system.", "The declarative bias allows the system to make use of a variety of types of prior knowledge directly and explicitly.", "desJardins (1994) describes a metbod for using background knowledge to evaluate and select biases dynamically with respect to expected accuracy and learning time in a decision-theoretic framework.", "This method provides an evaluation function over the space of representational biases L(H), and could be extended to evaluate procedural biases as well.", "Baltes and MacDonald (1992) and Datta and Kibler (1992) also describe methods that use previously learned concepts (prior knowledge) to bias the learning of new concepts.The use of prior knowledge to bias genetic algorithms and neural networks have re- cently been studied by several researchers.", "The systems of Gordon and Subramanian (1993) and Schultz and Grefenstette (1990) use prior knowledge to initialize a genetic algorithm.", "The former system uses high-level advice for the initialization.", "KBANN (Towell et al.", "1990) uses a domain theory in the form of propositional rules to

"Conclusi\u00f5ns The framework we have presented for treating blas selection as search has two essential features: blas is divided into representational and procedural components, and learning systems are characterized as potentially having multiple tiers of search (in hypothesis 20 D.

DESJARDINS space, bias space, meta-bias space, and so on).", "We advocate the use of this framework both as a tool for understanding, analyzing, and comparing existing systems, and as a basis for guiding the design and development of new machine learning systems.", "We believe that doing analysis and development within this framework will lead to a better understanding of where the implicit and explicit biases in learning systems lie, will reduce both system development and knowledge engineering time and effort, and will allow explicit representation and incorporation of considerations such as background knowledge and cost.", "Of course, the framework provides only the skeleton of a design and an abstract formalism for representing and analyzing bias as a multiple-tiered search process.", "The real work will come in the development of systems that fill in the components of the outline we have sketched, and that are able to perform learning in complex and dynamic domains.", "The papers in this issue begin to address some of the critical questions in this development; we hope that this special issue of Machine Learning inspires the research community to look more closely at the central issue of the evaluation and selection of biases in machine learning systems.", "AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Bill Spears and Pat Langley for insightful questions and in- teresting discussions on this topic, and Bill Spears, Rob Holte, Haym Hirsh, William Cohen, Paul Utgoff, David Aha, Lise Getoor, and Tom Dietterich for proofreading and commenting on earlier drafts.", "Their comments improved both the style and content of this paper.", "We also thank the reviewers for their thoughtful reviews of the papers in this issue.", "Notes 1.", "Biases can also affect the definition or selection of instances (see (Saxena 1991)).", "We omit a discussion of this topic for the sake of brevity.", "2.", "The arrows in Figure I go downward only.", "This is a simplification to clarify out presentation.", "Blas revision is typically both data- and model-driven, so that the lower tiers influence the higher tiers and vice versa."]
